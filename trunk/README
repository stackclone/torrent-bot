To run the torrent bot, first, make sure java is installed on your system, second, set the approriate variables in bot_config.py.  
Then, execute the run.sh shell script.

Currently, torrent bot needs to be run on the same machine as transmission daemon.

To find out the supported commands send the bot a "help" message.  

To download a torrent via torrent bot, use the download torrent command and pass it the url to the .torrent file on the tracker site.

Currently tested against transmission 1.51, built from source.

NOTE:

Before you can use Torrent Bot, you must create or already have an MSN account to be used with the script. 
Also, you must manually login as this account and accept yourself as a friend, if you already haven't done so. 
This may be confusing so below is some steps to try to help clarify:

Create an msn account for the bot. i.e my_bot@hotmail.com
login to your main account and add the bot account (i.e my_bot@hotmail.com) as a buddy
logout of your main account and login as the bot account
Add your main account as a buddy
login as your main account
